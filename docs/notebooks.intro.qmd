# Clojure for data science

Welcome reader, my name is Mario Gintili and this space is my attempt at self-documenting my learning journey.
My goal is to become a productive data scientist & machine learning engineer. I have a background in software engineering with;; Ruby/Rails & Node.js.

I was really impressed by the [scicloj](https://scicloj.github.io/) tech stack. It's the toolset I'll be using for this exploration

Without further ado, here's the syllabus that was kindly given to me by a colleague and fellow member of the community

- Introduction to Data Science & Clojure
- (Done) Intro to Clojure syntax, data structures, functions
- (Done) Setting up Clojure development environment
- Math & Stats Fundamental
- TODO - what goes here?
- Probability theory, distributions, hypothesis testing
-  Linear algebra basics (vectors, matrices, operations)
-  Descriptive statistics, exploratory data analysis
-  Exercises: Probability problems, basic data analysis
-  Data Manipulation with Clojure
-  Clojure sequences, collections, and data operations
- (Done) Intro to Clojure libs (tablecloth, hanami, fastmath, tech.ml.dataset)
- Data cleaning, merging, reshaping datasets
- Project: Clean and wrangle a dataset
- Data Visualization
- Principles of data visualization (Tufte, Wilkinson)
- Using oz, Vega/Vega-Lite libs for plots in Clojure
- Using plotly
- Creating common plots: Scatter, line, bar, histograms
- Project: Explore and visualize a dataset
- Statistical Models & Regression
- Simple/multiple linear regression
- Model fitting, evaluation metrics
- Case study: Predicting housing prices
- Classification
- Logistic regression, evaluation metrics
- Decision trees, random forests
- Case study: Spam classification
- Feature Engineering, Clustering & Dimensionality Reduction
- K-means clustering
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

- Databases & Big Data
- Intro to databases (SQL, NoSQL, graph)
- Big data concepts (MapReduce, Spark, Hadoop)
- Project: Analyze data from a database
- Natural Language Processing
- Text data preprocessing
- Topic modeling, sentiment analysis
- Project: Analyze text data (reviews, tweets, stock market commentary, etc)
- Time Series & Forecasting
- Trend, seasonality, autocorrelation
- ARIMA, exponential smoothing models
- Case study: Forecast product demand
- Recommendation Systems
