;; # Clojure

;; > Clojure is a dynamic, general-purpose programming language, combining the approachability and interactive development of a scripting language with an efficient and robust infrastructure for multithreaded programming.

;; [source](https://clojure.org/)

;; Cloure's official website has a really well and thorough documentation section.
;; Because of that there isn't really a need for me to go over it again.

;; That being said, I am learning Clojure myself so I will be putting down examples of every primitive that makes up the language itself

;; ## Numbers

;; A symbol is a reference to something else like a function, a value, a namespace, etc. Symbols can have a namespace, separated with a forward slash from the boolean values.

;; In a language like Ruby symbols are basically a frozen string, whereas in Cloure they are a reference to something else

;; Keywords on the other hand start leading with a colon and always evaluate themselves

;; ## Collections

;; Clojure has 4 core collection types

;; Clojure offers delaying the evaluation of an expression
;; with the use of a quote before the expression
